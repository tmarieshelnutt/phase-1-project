## Film industry examination.
We are examining various aspects of the film industry for a fledgling company, that is backed by an established firm.  We are examining avenues for said company to break into the film industry by providing recommendations for the initial film offerings.  Metrics from datafiles (csv, json, sql) were utilized to create graphical representations of the questions from the datafiles.  The questions examined in this repository are: 
1.	What was the revenue from the top 10 genre in the data set
(Broad range of options to begin with.)
2.	Whither a movie in the set passed or failed the Bechdel-Wallace test
(Examining a social metric for a socially conscious company.)
3.	What directors have experience in the above stated genre to streamline production.
(Experience in the film genre.)
Conclusions are made by the analyst and suggestions made regarding what the company should produce and why.
